# Basic Evolutionary Algorithm

USF Java class project 
Implements Basic Evolutionary Algorithm with flexible configuration

Done: 
  1. List genotype with fixed and var length
  2. Genotypes of bit and string genes (additional extensibility possible)
  3. Populations: List and Set
  4. Workbench for running may testes and building csv files with tuples (generation number, best solution)   
  
TODO: 
  1. Tree genotype 
  2. Crossover and mutation for tree genotype
  3. Program generation testing for provided functions: writing corresponding fitnesses
  
TODO:
  4. R integration and automation of graph building
